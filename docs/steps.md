# Steps to follow for the demo

This code base is being used to showcase the possibilities of GitHub Copilot.
In this demo we will analyze a simple code base and try to understand the algorithm.
After that we will refactor it into a separate class and add needed tests.

1. Ask about the goal of the calculateAll method
2. Ask about the used algorithm
3. Refactor the code into a separate class
4. Add tests for the new class
5. Run the tests
6. Refactor the code to make all tests succeed
7. Run the tests again
8. Ask about the next steps
9. Refactor the code for readability
10. Run the tests again
11. Ask about the next steps
12. Document the code
